# compose

Engine agnostic view rendering helpers for express.


## Installation

```bash
npm install express-compose
```


## How to use it?

There are two ways of using it. The simplest way is to call the methods `repeat()` and `decorate()`. They have almost the same signature than the express `render()` method: they're fed with a route result as an extra parameter in first position.

The second way is more elegant and preserves the express `render()` signature. It happens in two times: first the result is embedded in an object using the `wrap()` method. Then the object `repeat()` and `decorate()` methods can be used to achieve the same results.


```js
// madatory step: require the module
var compose = require('express-compose');

// simple way
compose.repeat(res, template, options, callback);

// elegant way
compose.wrap(res).repeat(template, options, callback);
```

The interest of the elegant way is that you can provide some options to the wrapper itself. Then the usage is:

```js
compose.wrap(res, wrapOptions).repeat(template, viewOptions, callback);
```


## How does repeat work?

It's similar to rendering, the difference being that instead of providing a option hash, you provide an array of hashes. The view will be rendered for each hash and the results will be concatenated.

```js
// ...
// setup of the app, some paths and rendering engine
// ...
var users = [{ name: 'tobi' }, { name: 'paul' }, { name: 'aure' }];
app.use(function(req, res) {
  compose.wrap(res).repeat('views/user', users);
});
```


## How does decorate work?

It's similar to rendering, the difference being that instead of providing a single template, you provide an array of them. The first template will be rendered, passed along with original options to the second one, which in turn will be ... until all templates are rendered.

```js
// ...
// setup of the app, some paths and rendering engine
// ...
var user = { name: 'tobi' };
app.use(function(req, res) {
  compose.wrap(res).decorate(['views/user', 'views/box'], user);
});

// The `box` template gets the following object:
{ name: 'tobi', content: res.render('view/user', user) }
```

Propagation of the original options to outer templates is very handy: It makes dead easy to set a title in a layout using the user properties, for example.

And if you don't like the default key name, you can change it when wrapping the result:

```js
// ...
// setup of the app, some paths and rendering engine
// ...
var user = { name: 'tobi' };
app.use(function(req, res) {
  compose.wrap(res, { compose: 'rendered' }).decorate(['views/user', 'views/box'], user);
});

// The `box` template now gets the following object, with the customized key:
{ name: 'tobi', rendered: res.render('view/user', user) }
```
